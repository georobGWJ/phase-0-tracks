What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
================================================================================
Semantic tags serve many purposes. One is to provide information for machine-readers that might be serving content to visually-imapired users or possibly to data-mining bots or other data parsers. Another is to allow for more granular application of css styles. A third is to provide context to other coders that might be reading your code to understand what you were thinking and what purpose pieces of content serve.

From what I have built so far, I believe that some of the most useful optional semantic tags include <main>, <section>, <headers>, <figure>, <img>, <figcaption>, <p>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <nav>, <a>, <cite>, and <table>. These should capture the bulk of use cases.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
=================================================================
By default, a web browser will display elements in the order that they appear in the html file. As an example, a <header> element located at the bottom of the code will still render at the bottom of the webpage by default, despite being a header. This can be modified via css style sheets.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
================================================================================
Snippets! The ability to extend the functionality of Sublime by using these is awesome. I am already planning on creating at least one new snippet and thinking about others.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
================================================================================
Snippets! I understand how to build basic snippets but it seems like they have a lot more power than the basic examples demonstrate. For example, in the content, ${} can probably add much more flexibility and nuance to the tab responses.
