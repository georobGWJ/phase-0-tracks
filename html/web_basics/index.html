  <h1>William Gibson: Author and Noir Prophet</h1>
  <p>William Gibson is easily my <em>favorite</em> author of all time. Although most widely credited for introducing the term "cyberspace" in his early novels <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Burning-Chrome-William-Gibson/dp/0060539828/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1470684091&sr=8-1&keywords=burning+chrome >Burning Chrome</a> and <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Neuromancer-William-Gibson/dp/0441569595/ref=pd_sim_14_3?ie=UTF8&dpID=51mgToICE3L&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR97%2C160_&psc=1&refRID=4EZ5SZYJDSDN0SYP1XQC> Neuromancer</a>, Gibson's writing has explored effects of technology, cybernetics, and computer networks on humans, the sociology of future urban environments, and the complex interactions of real and virtual spaces in the modern day setting.</p>
