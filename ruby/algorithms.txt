Pseudocode Algorithm for Using an Elevator
==========================================
Assumptions: The robot is on an arbitrary floor standing in front of the elevator. The robot is sufficiently human like that it physically operates like a human would.

Algorithm:
1. Locate elevator call button.
2. If going to a higher floor, press the elevator up button.
    Else if going to a lower floor, press the elevator down button.
    Else you must already be on the floor you want to be on. Congratulations!
3. Wait to hear chime of elevator arriving.
4. Wait for elevator door to open. 
5. If there are exiting humans or robots, wait for them to exit.
6. Enter elevator and turn to face elevator door.
7. Locate bank of buttons with floor numbers on them.
8. Read upper left button.
    a. If button has the floor number you want to go to, press button.
    b. Else look at button to the right of the button you just read.
       c. If there is no button to the right, move down one row and move to the button furthest to the left.
    d. Repeat steps 8 a. through c. until you find the floor you want and press that floor button.
9. Wait for elevator to move.
10. When elevator stops, look at floor number lit on the panel or above the door.
    a. If this lit floor number is the one that you wanted, wait for elevator door to open and exit elevator. Congratulations, you did it!
    b. Else, wait patiently for the elevator door to close and for the elevator to keep moving.
    c. Repeat 10 a. and b. until you reach the floor you want.
