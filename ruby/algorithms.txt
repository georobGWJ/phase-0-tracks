Pseudocode Algorithm for Using an Elevator
==========================================
Assumptions: The robot is on an arbitrary floor standing in front of the elevator. The robot is sufficiently human like that it physically operates like a human would.

Algorithm:
1. Locate elevator call button.
2. If going to a higher floor, press the elevator up button.
    Else if going to a lower floor, press the elevator down button.
    Else you must already be on the floor you want to be on. Congratulations!
3. Wait to hear chime of elevator arriving.
4. Wait for elevator door to open. 
5. If there are exiting humans or robots, wait for them to exit.
6. Enter elevator and turn to face elevator door.
7. Locate bank of buttons with floor numbers on them.
8. Read upper left button.
    a. If button has the floor number you want to go to, press button.
    b. Else look at button to the right of the button you just read.
       c. If there is no button to the right, move down one row and move to the button furthest to the left.
    d. Repeat steps 8 a. through c. until you find the floor you want and press that floor button.
9. Wait for elevator to move.
10. When elevator stops, look at floor number lit on the panel or above the door.
    a. If this lit floor number is the one that you wanted, wait for elevator door to open and exit elevator. Congratulations, you did it!
    b. Else, wait patiently for the elevator door to close and for the elevator to keep moving.
    c. Repeat 10 a. and b. until you reach the floor you want.

Pseudocode Algorithm for my Cat's Normal Behavior Loop
======================================================
Assumptions: Berkeley the cat (I didn't name her, I adopted her pre-named) is healthy and acting normally. Her water is full and her litterbox is clean, wet or dry food may be available. There are two office chairs. This algorithm starts at the beginning of the loop.

Algorithm:
1. Sleep for one to two hours on current office chair.
2. Wake up, meow and stretch.
3. Climb down from chair.
4. Walk down hall towards front of house until kitchen is to the left
5. Turn left and enter kitchen.
6. Locate water bowl and drink some water.
7. If hungry and wet food is in bowl in kitchen, eat wet food
    Else: 
    a. Turn back towards hall and walk forward until reaching hall 
    b. Turn left, walk down hall towards front of house until laundry room is to the left
    c. Turn left and enter laundry room.
    d. Locate dry food bowl. If bowl is empty meow loudly and indignantly, else eat dry food.
8. If needing to use litterbox, locate litterbox in laundry room, enter litterbox and do your thing.
    a. turn back towards hall and walk forward until reaching hall 
    b. turn right, walk down hall towards back of house until kitchen is to the right
    c. Turn right and enter kitchen.
    d. Locate water bowl. Wash excess litter off of paws in water bowl.  
9.  a. Turn back towards hall and walk forward until reaching hall 
    b. Turn right, walk down hall towards back of house until office is to the right
    c. Turn right and enter office.
    d. Climb onto desk, stand directly in front of monitor.
    e. Stare at human for up to 15 minutes. If human gets out of the office chair they're occupying, claim chair as new bed. Else if human hasn't moved after 15 minutes return to other office chair.
10. Go back to sleep.
