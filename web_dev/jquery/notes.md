DBC Challenge 9.3 - JQuery

*Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.*

**Study Plan**
I plan on starting learning about JQuery by finding it's official page. While there I will read the high level overview of the features and uses of JQuery and if the page has a tutorial or quick start guide, I will work through that as well. In addition, I will find and bookmark some good cheatsheets or useful reference sites for JQuery. If there is no tutorial at the official site or if it's too simple or too complex I will Google for JQuery tutorials. I'll probably take one break, about one hour in.

**Release 1: Study Up**
*LEARN THE THING (2 HOURS MAX)*
*Time to execute your plan. Aaaand ... go! When the time is up, record in notes.md which strategies seemed to be the most effective.*



**Release 2: Make a Thing**
*DO THE THING (45 MINUTES MAX)*
*Make a jQuery project and add it to the jquery directory. It can be tiny, and it can do whatever you like, as long as you can say in good faith that you're practicing what you've learned and improving your jQuery skills.*
